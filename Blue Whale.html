            <p>Blue whales are a type of Baleen Whale and belong to the family Balaenoptera musculus. They are found
                mostly in poles during the summer and towards the tropics during the winter. They are 28.9 metres or 98
                feet long and weigh up to 199 tons. Blue whales were almost hunted down to extinction towards the end of
                the 19th century. They are considered endangered species by the UN. Blue whales mostly feed on krill and
                do not need to make groups for hunting hence they tend to be very solitary creatures. Blues whales can
                communicate with each other in 8 to 25 hertz. Krill makes up almost all of the blue whale's diet. When
                blue whales lunge feed, they swim towards krill at great speeds while opening their mouths to an angle
                of up to 80 degrees. They have the capacity to swallow 220 metric tons of water at once (220 long tons
                and 240 short tons). Using pressure from their tongue and throat pouch, they force the water out of
                their baleen plates and ingest the remaining krill. Blue whales have been observed performing 180-degree
                rolls when lunge-feeding, which may help them scour the prey area for the densest areas. The orca is the
                sole known natural predator of blue whales, though it is unknown how often orcas actually attack and
                kill them. According to research using photographs to identify blue whales, several of the individuals
                in the Gulf of California had scars resembling rakes, which are a sign of confrontations with orcas.
                3.7% of the blue whales recorded off Southeast Australia had rake marks, and 42.1% of the pygmy blue
                whales seen off Western Australia had rake marks. Orca predation has only occasionally been observed.
                Off the southeast coast of Australia, a blue whale mother and baby were initially seen being pursued by
                orcas at high speeds. The family Balaenopteridae includes rorquals such as blue whales. The
                Balaenopteridae family separated from other families between 10.48 and 4.98 million years ago, during
                the late Miocene, according to a 2018 research. The earliest known anatomically modern blue whale is a
                fragmentary skull fossil from the Early Pleistocene, which occurred between 1.5 and 1.25 million years
                ago.

                It was discovered in southern Italy. The Last Glacial Maximum saw the separation of the Australian
                pygmy blue whale. The subspecies has a relatively low genetic diversity as a result of its more recent
                separation, while New Zealand blue whales have an even lower genetic diversity. Fin whales and blue
                whales have been found to breed together. A 20-meter aberrant female whale having characteristics of
                both blue and fin whales that was captured in the North Pacific is the first description of a potential
                blue and fin whale hybrid. It was discovered that a whale captured off the coast of northwest Spain in
                1984 was the offspring of a blue whale mother and a fin whale father. Since then, two blue-fin whale
                hybrids have been seen in the Azores and the Gulf of St. Lawrence, both in Portugal and Canada. The
                results of DNA tests conducted in Iceland on a blue whale that was killed in July 2018 by the Icelandic
                whaling business Hvalur revealed that the whale was the progeny of a male fin whale and female blue
                whale; nevertheless, the results are subject to independent testing and sample verification. Blue whale
                meat trading is prohibited since they are considered "Protection Stocks" by the International Whaling
                Commission, and the kill is a crime that needs to be reported. Genetic testing of whale meat samples
                collected from Japanese markets has revealed the existence of blue-fin hybrids. Blue whale meat trading
                is prohibited since they are considered "Protection Stocks" by the International Whaling Commission, and

                Japanese markets has revealed the existence of blue-fin hybrids. Hybrid blue-fin whales have the
                potential to reproduce. A 21-meter pregnant female whale was taken off the coast of Iceland in 1986.
                Molecular studies revealed that the whale had a blue whale mother and a fin whale father, and that the
                baby was sired by a blue whale. Blue whales have a lifespan of at least 80 to 90 years.

                In order to determine the age of a blue whale, scientists examine its earwax or ear plug. A light and
                dark coating of wax is placed every year in accordance with the times when people are fasting during migration and
                when they are feeding. Thus, the age of each group is indicated. This method gives a pygmy blue whale a
                maximum age limit of 73 years. Additionally, every time a female blue whale ovulates, her ovaries get
                white scars called corpora albicantia. Every 2.6 years on average, a corpus albicans develops in a
                female pygmy blue whale. Although they occasionally travel in couples, blue whales are typically
                solitary. Blue whales can congregate in groups of more than 50 when productivity is strong enough to
                allow for this. In order to reach their winter breeding sites in more tropical waters for the season,
                populations may embark on lengthy migrations from their summer feeding grounds near the poles. To find
                the ideal eating locations, the animals reportedly employ memory.

                Alternative tactics including
                year-round residence, partial migration (when only a portion of the population moves, or migration based
                on age or gender), or age- or sex-based migration have been shown to work. The feeding of some whales at
                calving grounds has been observed. Blue whales may move at speeds of 5 to 30 kilometers per hour.
                According to blue whales with tags, the deepest dive was 315 meters. However, the longest dive that was
                recorded was only 15.2 minutes, well below their anticipated 31.2 minute maximum aerobic dive time. A
                pygmy blue whale dived as deep as 510 meters, according to certified data. A blue whale's heart rate can
                fall to 2 beats per minute when it is submerged, but it can jump to 37 bpm when it comes to the surface,
                which is almost its maximal heart rate. Some of the loudest and lowest frequency vocalizations in the
                animal realm are made by blue whales. and it appears that their inner ears are well-suited to hearing
                low-frequency sounds. Blue whale vocalizations have a fundamental frequency range of 8 to 25 Hz. The
                songs of blue whales differ between populations.

                The number of mature blue whales worldwide is thought to be between 5,000 and 15,000, with a total population of between 10,000 and 25,000 as of 2018. In
                1926, there were at least 140,000 adult whales, in comparison. The number of whales in the North
                Atlantic is estimated to be 1,000 to 3,000, those in the North Pacific to be 3,000 to 5,000, and those
                in the Antarctic to be 5,000 to 8,000. The number of whales in the eastern South Pacific might be between 1,000
                and 3,000, whereas the pygmy blue whale population could range between 2,000 and 5,000. In parts of the
                Southern Hemisphere, blue whales have been protected since 1939. They received total protection in the
                North Atlantic beginning in 1955 thanks to the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling;
                this protection was then expanded to the Antarctic and the North Pacific in 1965 and 1966, respectively.
                Iceland did not acknowledge the North Atlantic blue whales as protected until 1960. The Endangered
                Species Act provides protection for the species in the US.
