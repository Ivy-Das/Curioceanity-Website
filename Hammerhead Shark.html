            <p>Hammer head sharks are a type of shark which are part of the Sphyrnidae family. They are called
                “hammerhead” as their head is flattened and is in the shape of a hammer. These sharks are mostly found
                in warm water near the coastlines and continental shelves. They are solitary and hunt prey individually
                during the night but during they day they swim in schools. They can be as small as 2 feet or as big as 9
                feet. This shark also has 360° vision as their eyes are placed at the end of their head. The sharks’
                diet includes of octopi, squid, crustaceans and other smaller fish which may include other sharks. They
                do sometimes feed on seagrass and are considered potentially omnivorous. Hammerhead sharks do not have
                any bones and are not possible to be turned into fossils. Only shark teeth are frequently discovered as
                fossils because sharks do not have mineralized bones and rarely fossilize. The requiem sharks are their
                nearest cousins (Carcharinidae).

                Hammerheads' ancestor most likely existed in the Early Miocene epoch
                about 20 million years ago, according to DNA tests and fossil evidence. The winghead shark was
                identified as the most primitive component of the evolutionary tree of hammerhead sharks constructed
                using mitochondrial DNA. Given that the winghead shark has the largest "hammer" in terms of proportion
                among hammerhead sharks, this may indicate that the earliest ancestors of hammerhead sharks also had
                large hammers. The animal's skull may have developed into its hammer-like shape in part to improve its
                vision. The placement of the eyes, which are situated on the sides of the shark's distinctive
                hammer-shaped head, provides for 360-degree vertical vision, allowing the animals to always see above
                and below them. Due to the cephalofoil, they also have improved binocular vision and depth of field.

                Hammerhead sharks only reproduce once a year, and when they do, it usually involves the male biting the
                female aggressively until she consents to mate. Female hammerhead sharks give birth to live pups
                according to the viviparous mode of reproduction. Similar to other shark species, claspers, which are
                two intromittent structures, are used by the male to transmit sperm to the female during fertilization.
                A yolk sac initially provides support to the developing embryos. The depleted yolk sac changes into a
                structure resembling a placenta in mammals when the supply of yolk is reduced, providing the mother with
                nutrition up until delivery. Shark parents do not in any manner care for their young after they are
                born. A litter typically has 12 to 15 pups, with the exception of the great hammerhead, which has
                litters with 20 to 40 pups. Until they are big enough and old enough to survive on their own, these
                young sharks group up and go toward warmer waters. A wide variety of prey, including fish (including
                other sharks), squid, octopus, and crustaceans, are consumed by hammerhead sharks. One particular
                favorite is stingrays. 
            </p>
            <p>
                These sharks are frequently seen stalking their food by swimming around the ocean
                floor. When pursuing prey, they use their distinctive heads as a weapon. When a stingray is weak and in
                shock, the hammerhead shark will use its head to pin it down and consume it. The great hammerhead
                occasionally engages in cannibalism, consuming other hammerhead sharks, including its own young. It is
                often larger and more ferocious than most hammerheads. Bonnetheads have been observed to consume
                seagrass in addition to their regular animal diet, which can account for up to 50% of their stomach
                contents. Even if they mistakenly consume it, they can still partially digest it. The only known
                instance of a shark species that may be omnivorous is this one. The main danger to hammerhead sharks is
                humans. Hammerhead sharks are taken in fisheries all around the world, despite the fact that they are
                typically not the main target. Because hammerheads like to live in warm seas, tropical fisheries are
                where they are most frequently found. 
            </p>

                The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations Global
                Capture Production dataset includes information on the total number of hammerheads landed in fisheries.
                From 75 metric tons in 1990 to 6,313 metric tons in 2010, the amount rose substantially. Hammerhead
                sharks, according to merchants in shark fins, have some of the best fin needles, making them tasty when
                cooked properly. With a share of around 1.5% of all yearly fin trade, Hong Kong is the largest fin trade
                market in the world. Approximately 375,000 great hammerhead sharks alone are thought to be sold
                annually, which equates to 21,000 metric tons of biomass. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It is crucial to keep in mind, though, that
                the majority of sharks that are caught are just used for their fins before being thrown away.
                Hammerheads' genuine meat is typically not desired. Regular hammerhead meat consumption has been
                documented in nations like Trinidad and Tobago, Eastern Venezuela, Kenya, and Japan. The hammerhead,
                oceanic whitetip, and porbeagle sharks were three endangered species with high commercial value that
                were added to Appendix II of CITES in March 2013. As a result, shark fishing and shark trade are now
                subject to licensing and regulation.
