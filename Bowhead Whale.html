            <p>The bowhead whale or Balaena mysticetus is a baleen whale and is found in the arctic regions or sub
                arctic regions. They are one of the longest living mammals on the planet having an average lifespan of
                200 years and can have mouths as big as 1/3 of their total body length. Before 1966 this species of
                whale was driven to near extinction due to the fact it was considered a sporting event to capture and
                kill whales of such humongous sizes. But now the UN has declared the whale to be of least concern as
                their numbers have seemed to increase significantly after the moratorium of 1966. They are 19 meters in
                length and can spout water as high as 20 feet, they weigh about 80 metric tons. Their skulls are
                triangular in shape and have a light under side and a dark body. Bowheads are not social as they prey on
                relatively small animals which do not need too much effort to trap but sometimes, they can for small
                pods of 6 to hunt for bigger prey. They mostly feed on copepods, krill and crustaceans. According to John
                Edward Gray's work from 1821, the bowhead whale now belongs to a monotypic genus that is distinct from
                the right whales. The family Balaenidae was the focus of intense taxonometric discussion for the
                following 180 years. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The three populations of right whales and the bowhead whale have frequently been
                reclassified by authorities as one, two, three, or four species, either in a single genus or in two
                different genera. The distinction between bowhead and right whales was eventually accepted, but there
                was still some debate over whether they belonged to the same genus or to separate ones. The bowhead
                whale has a broad, sturdy body that is dark, with a white chin. It possesses a huge triangular skull
                that it uses as a breathing hole on the Arctic ice. In 60 cm of ice, Inuit hunters have reported seeing
                bowhead sharks surface. Additionally, the lower jaw is sharply bent, and the upper jaw is quite small.
                With a length of 3 m, its baleen are the longest of any whale and are used to fish out small prey from
                the ocean. At the top of its head, where there are two blowholes, the bowhead whale is capable of
                ejecting a 6.1 m-high blast. With a maximum thickness of 43 to 50 cm, the bowhead has the thickest
                blubber of any animal. The bowhead whale lacks a dorsal fin, in contrast to most cetaceans. The lack of a dorsal
                fin in the bowhead is an adaptation for spending a lot of time under sea surface ice, unlike most
                cetaceans. The vestigial pelvis of the bowhead whale is unconnected to the spine, just like those of the
                sperm whale and other cetaceans.

                The body of the bowhead whale is massive and strong, dark in color, with a white chin and lower jaw. It
                can breathe through the Arctic ice because to its enormous triangular cranium. Bowhead sharks have been
                surfacing through 60 cm of ice, according to Inuit hunters. It also has a thin top jaw and a lower jaw
                that is deeply bent. Its 3 m-long baleen, the longest of any whale, are used to sift out microscopic
                prey from the water. A blow from the bowhead whale's pair of blowholes, located at the top of the head,
                can reach a height of 6.1 meters. The bowhead whale has the thickest blubber of any mammal, measuring up
                to 50 centimeters. The lack of a dorsal fin in the bowhead is an adaptation for spending a lot of time
                under sea surface ice, unlike most cetaceans. The vestigial pelvis of the bowhead whale is unconnected
                to the spine, just like those of the sperm whale and other cetaceans. A large amount of the genetic
                diversity of Arctic bowhead whales has been lost during the past 500 years, according to an analysis of
                hundreds of DNA samples taken from living whales as well as baleen used in toys, boats, and housing
                material. Bowheads originally traveled ice-covered straits and inlets to exchange genetic material
                between populations in the Atlantic and Pacific. This finding was reached after using mitochondrial DNA
                to examine maternal lineage. The loss of genetic variety is thought to be the result of whaling and
                climate cooling during the Little Ice Age, which lasted from the 16th to the 19th century.

            <p>
                The bowhead whale is a solitary creature that usually travels in tiny groups of up to six. It has the
                ability to dive and stay underwater for up to an hour. Typically, a single dive can only last between 9
                and 18 minutes underwater. Although it is believed that the bowhead is not a deep diver, it can dive as
                far as 150 m. It swims slowly, typically moving at a speed of 2 to 5 km/h. It is capable of traveling at
                a pace of 10 km/h when escaping danger. The average swim speed rises to 1.1 to 2.5 m/s during feeding
                times. The bowhead whale's head is one-third the length of its body, forming a massive feeding machine.
                The bowhead whale feeds by swimming forward with its mouth open as it is a filter feeder. Its upper jaw
                is adorned with hundreds of keratin-based baleen plates that cover one another. A wide, upward-facing
                lip on the lower jaw of the mouth serves to support and hold the baleen plates inside the mouth.
                Additionally, this prevents the plates from bending or breaking due to the pressure of the water passing
                through them as the whale moves forward. To catch prey, water is forced through the tiny keratin hairs
                on the baleen plates, holding it close to the tongue before it is ingested. Zooplankton, which contains
                copepods, amphipods, and numerous other crustaceans, makes up the majority of the diet. Every day,
                almost 1.8 tonnes of food are devoured. Bowheads are solitary or live in groups of two to ten or more
                when they are foraging. When traveling, feeding, and socializing, bowhead whales are very vocal and use
                low frequency (1000 Hz) sounds to communicate. Especially during migratory season, loud sounds are made
                for communication and navigation. Bowhead whales produce lengthy, intricate, and varied songs as mating
                calls throughout the breeding season. A colony of about 300 animals sang 184 different songs over the
                years of 2010 and 2014 near Greenland.

                The longest-living mammal is thought to be the bowhead whale, which can live for more than 200 years.
                The 90 mm head of an explosive bomb lance with a model made between 1879 and 1885 was found on a
                15-meter specimen that was caught off the coast of Alaska in May 2007. This indicates that the whale was
                likely bomb lanced between those years, and its age at death was estimated to be between 115 and 130
                years. In response to this finding, researchers determined the ages of several bowhead whales; one
                specimen was calculated to be 211 years old. The age range for other bowhead whales was put at 135 to
                172 years. This finding demonstrated that the bowhead whale lives much longer than previously believed.
                The genetic sequence of bowhead whales indicated that their maximum lifetime is 268 years, according to
                experts at CSIRO, Australia's national science organization. It was originally thought that an organism
                with more cells had a higher likelihood of developing mutations that lead to cancer and age-related
                disorders. Despite having thousands of times more cells than other animals, the bowhead whale possesses
                a significantly stronger resistance to cancer and aging. In 2015, US and UK researchers were successful
                in mapping the whale's genome. Two alleles that might be in charge of the whale's longevity were found
                through comparative research. The ERCC1 gene and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) gene are
                the two specific gene alterations that have been connected to the bowhead whale's capacity to live
                longer. DNA repair and improved cancer resistance are both associated with ERCC1.

                For the BCB bowhead whale, the International Whaling Commission (IWC) established a hunting strike quota
                in 1978. Since 1998, the quota has stayed at 67 strikes annually, or around 0.5% of the BCB population.
                West Greenland and Canada are home to an estimated 6,000 bowhead whales, and hunting pressure there is
                very low (less than 0.001 percent). Both stocks are growing, and it appears that local hunts can support
                themselves. Another well-known predator is the killer whale. The exact number of killer whale deaths is
                unknown. When threatened by killer whales, bowheads seek refuge in the ice and shallow waters. To put
                this conduct in historical perspective and show that it is not a recent phenomenon, the Inuit have a
                phrase for it. Killer whale sightings in the far north are becoming more frequent as a result of global
                warming. Killer whale sightings, which were historically uncommon, are growing more common. Shark
                attacks on bowheads have not been reported. Hunters have targeted bowhead whales for their blubber,
                meat, oil, bones, and baleen. It is perfect for whaling because, like the right whale, it moves slowly
                and floats after it dies. It was believed that there were 50,000 of them prior to commercial whaling.
                When the Basques killed them during their fall and early winter migration south across the Strait of
                Belle Isle, commercial bowhead whaling got its start. The first whaling expedition arrived in
                Spitsbergen in 1611. On Spitsbergen, Smeerenburg, a whaling town, was established in 1619. Whalers were
                forced to travel into the "West Ice," the pack ice off Greenland's east coast, by the middle of the
                twentieth century since the population(s) there had been all but wiped out. Following that, bowheads
                were caught in Tausk Bay and Northeast Gulf along the pack ice in the northern Sea of Okhotsk (Shelikhov
                Gulf). Ships quickly grew westward, catching them first around Iony Island and subsequently the Shantar
                Islands. They primarily captured them in the Anadyr Gulf, the Bering Strait, and the area surrounding
                St. Lawrence Island in the Western Arctic. Later, in 1854, they made their way to the delta of the
                Mackenzie River and the western Beaufort Sea (1889). The main factor contributing to the population
                drop, commercial whaling, has ended. Native Americans in North America are currently engaged in
                subsistence hunting of bowhead whales.
