            <p>Leopard Shark</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">

            <p>Leopard Sharks belong to the Triakedae family. They are mostly found near the Pacific coast where the
                water is less than 13 feet deep. They are 4 feet to 5 feet long and have large saddle-like spots on
                their back which gives them the name “leopard”. This shark is harmless to humans and is captured for
                food and aquariums. A leopard shark’s diet consists of shrimp, worms, crabs, bony fish, clams and fish
                eggs. From the temperate continental waters of Coos Bay, Oregon to the tropical waters of Mazatlán,
                Mexico, including the Gulf of California, the leopard shark can be found in the Northeastern Pacific
                Ocean. It prefers muddy or sandy flats in enclosed bays and estuaries, though it can also be found close
                to kelp forests, rocky reefs, or on open coastlines. It has been observed that crowds assemble close to
                power plant discharges of heated wastewater. Although they can be found as deep as 91 m, leopard sharks
                typically stay near to the bottom and are most common from the intertidal zone to a depth of 4 m. In the
                north, in particular, many leopard sharks leave their coastal homes in the winter and come back in the
                first few weeks of spring. They leave when the water temperature falls below 10 degrees, according to a
                research in Tomales Bay in northern California; one tagged shark was discovered to have traveled around
                140 kilometers south.
            </p>

            <p>
                The leopard shark has a short, rounded snout and a body that is somewhat thick. In front of the nares,
                there are well-developed, triangular skin flaps. Large, round eyes with a nictitating membrane are
                present (a protective third eyelid). The mouth has a sharply curled line. The lower jaw's furrows almost
                reach the midline, and there are furrows at the corners of the mouth that continue across both jaws.
                Each tooth has a slightly oblique, smooth-edged cusp in the center and one to two tiny cusplets on
                either side. The tooth rows range from rows 41 to 55 in the upper jaw and 34 to 45 in the lower jaw.
                These teeth are arranged into a flat, ridged surface that resembles a "pavement." The enormous first
                dorsal fin lies almost midway between the pelvic and pectoral fins; the second is almost as big as the
                first and much bigger than the anal fin. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The triangular, broad pectoral fins. Although the higher lobe
                of the caudal fin, which has a pronounced ventral notch near the tip, is longer and more developed in
                adults, the lower lobe is less than half as long. On a silvery to bronzy gray background, there are
                distinctive black "saddles" and big black patches that run up the back. Compared to immature sharks,
                adults frequently have more spots and saddles with lighter centers. White and plain describes the
                underside. A leopard shark typically measures 1.2 to 1.5 meters in length. Rarely, males can reach
                lengths of 1.5 m, while females can reach lengths of 1.8 m. One remarkable female once measured 2.1 m in
                length. The largest leopard shark ever recorded weighed 18.4 kg. Small benthic and littoral animals make
                up the leopard shark's diet, particularly crabs (Cancridae, Grapsidae, and Hippoidea), shrimp, bony fish
                (such as anchovies, herring, topsmelt, croakers, surfperch, gobies, rockfish, sculpins, flatfish, and
                midshipmen), fish eggs, clams, and the echiurid fat innkeeper (Urechis caupo). Additionally, this
                opportunistic hunter has been observed consuming bat rays, ghost shrimp, polychaete worms, smoothhound
                pups, and shovelnose guitarfish (Rhinobatos productus) (Myliobatis californicus).
            </p>
            <p>
                Algae and eelgrass
                (Zostera) can accidentally be consumed. The labial cartilages of the leopard shark swing forward to
                convert the mouth into a tube, which aids in the suction force used to capture prey by enlarging the
                buccal cavity. The shark simultaneously thrusts its jaws forward to catch its food between its teeth.
                The leopard shark sheds and regrows its teeth on a regular basis, and it takes between 9 and 12 days for
                a new tooth to erupt. It has been observed that leopard sharks have stomachs stuffed with clam siphons.
                The sharks catch the clams before they can retract and break off with a levering motion of their body.
                On occasion, the shark will do this to completely rip the clam out of its shell. Other sharks that were
                examined had whole innkeeper worms in their stomachs but no bite marks, indicating that they had sucked
                them out of their burrows. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Leopard sharks and spiny dogfish have been seen in San Francisco Bay feasting
                on a dense school of anchovies by slowly swimming against the school's clockwise motion and ingesting
                any anchovies that unintentionally fell into their open mouths. Leopard sharks are cautious and quick to
                run, thus they are hardly a threat to people. The only instance of a leopard shark bothering a skin
                diver with a nosebleed is from 1955, however there were no injuries as a result. Recreational anglers,
                spearfishers, commercial fisheries, bottom trawls, and commercial fisheries all use gillnets and
                longlines to catch this species. The meat is offered fresh or frozen and is regarded as great food.
                However, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife advises against regularly eating leopard sharks
                since they may acquire contaminants like mercury, pesticides, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in
                their bodies by coexisting with human growth. Due to the leopard shark's high value in the aquarium
                trade and its toughness, many newborn pups were caught with hook-and-line off the coast of southern
                California in the late 1980s and early 1990s. 
            </p>

                In captivity, it might survive for more than 20 years. The
                leopard shark has been categorized as being of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation
                of Nature (IUCN). Due to its slow growth rate and limited level of interchange between regional stocks,
                it is extremely vulnerable to local depletion. It was taken into consideration for the 1982 Groundfish
                Management Plan of the U.S. Pacific Fishery Management Council (PMC), although it is not controlled
                under that plan. The sport fishing sector vigorously advocated and supported the state of California's
                decision to set a recreational minimum size limit of 91 cm and a possession limit of three fish in 1992.
                A minimum size restriction of 46 cm was also put in place by the State in 1993 for the commercial
                harvesting of all sharks and rays, including those used in the aquarium trade.
