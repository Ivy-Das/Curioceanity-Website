            <p>Blanket Octopus</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">

            <p>Blanket octopi are mostly found on the surface of tropic or sub-tropic regions of the oceans. They get
                their name due to the fact that their tentacles are connected to each other by thin blanket like
                structures or excess skin-webs. The male and juvenile female blanket octopodes cut off the poisonous
                Portuguese man o' war tentacles and use them for both aggressive and defensive purposes, however blanket
                octopodes are immune to its venom. The blanket octopus, like many other octopuses, squirts ink at
                potential predators to terrify them.

            <p>
                Additionally, the female expands her huge membranes, which resemble
                a net, when she feels threatened, making herself appear much larger than she actually is. They seek for
                food while residing in coral reefs. Most of their prey can be found in or close to coral reefs, and
                their diet consists primarily of smaller fish. In the reef, they may also hide from larger fish and
                whales, two of their main predators. The coral reefs on which the Blanket Octopus is strongly dependent
                are under grave risk as a result of human-caused climate change. Coral bleaching and ocean acidification
                are two threats to these reefs. The Blanket Octopus is a nomadic species that can move around and find
                shelter elsewhere.

            <p>
                They also have the ability to adapt to changing ocean temperatures, giving them two
                defense mechanisms that protect them from the effects of climate change. Despite the fact that this can
                be dangerous for the Blanket Octopus because it is their habitat, these animals have two defense
                mechanisms that protect them from these changes. The sexual size-dimorphism of this octopus is among the
                most dramatic yet observed in an animal its size or greater. Males are only 2.4 cm long, whereas females
                can grow to a length of 2 m.

                The weight ratio ranges from 10,000:1 to 40,000:1. The males have a huge
                arm inside of a hectocotylus, a round pouch modified for mating. This arm is separated during mating and
                maintained by the female in her mantle cavity until it is utilized for fertilization. After mating, the
                male typically passes away. Males compete with one another, as evidenced by the presence of several male
                arms in females' mantle cavities. More than 100,000 eggs are carried by the females on a sausage-shaped
                calcareous secretion that is kept at the base of the dorsal arms and carried by the female till
                hatching.
