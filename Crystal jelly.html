            <p>Aequorea victoria, also sometimes called the crystal jelly, is a hydromedusa, that is found off the west
                coast of North America. This fish is best known for their fluorescent features. The crystal jellyfish is
                mostly colourless and transparent. It has bells with small uneven tentacles and has a large
                contractionary mouth. The bell is ringed with a muscular velum which has the green fluorescent protein.
                The tentacles also possess nematocytes which are harmful to their prey but are ineffective to humans.
                They mostly feed on planktons and sometimes the larger jelly fish prey on crustaceans.

                From the Bering Sea to southern California, the Pacific Ocean's west coast of North America is home to Aequorea
                victoria. The pelagic organism that makes up the medusa portion of the life cycle budded off a
                bottom-dwelling polyp in late spring. In the eastern Pacific Ocean, you can find medusae floating and
                swimming both close to shore and offshore; this species is particularly prevalent in Puget Sound.
                Aequorea victoria was discovered in the Moray Firth in September 2009, which was unique because crystal
                jellies had never been observed or recorded in British waters. The specimen was shown in Scotland's
                Aberdeenshire at the Macduff Marine Aquarium.

                It can be challenging to distinguish between different Aequorea species because the primary physical
                characteristics used for identification are size, number of tentacles, number of radial canals, number
                of marginal statocysts, and number of tentacles. The number of tentacles and radial canals increases
                with size in all species of Aequorea, and these characteristics are fairly flexible. Aequorea
                coerulescens, a different species that occasionally occurs in the same region as Aequorea victoria, has
                been identified. 
            </p>
            <p>
                While it appears that A. coerulescens is typically found offshore in the eastern
                Pacific Ocean, unusual specimens have been identified near Friday Harbor, North Puget Sound, and central
                California. Aequorea coerulescens is morphologically similar to Aequorea victoria, but it is larger
                (about the size of a dinner plate) and has a great deal more radial canals. Identifications based on
                morphology can be challenging for animals with sizes in between these two forms because they also have
                somewhat intermediate appearances. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The life history of Aequorea victoria is dimorphic, changing
                seasonally between sexual planktonic medusae and asexual benthic polyps. Late spring sees the asexual
                budding of young Aequorea victoria hydroid medusae, which are free-living hydromedusae that spend their
                whole lives in the plankton. The medusa spends its first stage of life rapidly expanding and starts
                producing gametes for reproduction when it is around 3 cm long. The gender of each medusa is either male
                or female. Given enough nourishment, the eggs and spermatozoa mature daily in the medusa gonads before
                being free-spawned in response to a daily light cue into the water column, where they are fertilized and
                eventually settle out to create a new hydroid colony. The hydroids are bottom-dwelling animals that live
                on hard or rocky substrates. Each spring, in response to an unidentified environmental trigger, they
                asexually bud new, microscopic jellyfish (s). The lifespan of the medusa form is typically 6 months, or
                roughly from late spring to early fall.
            </p>

                The diet of Aequorea victoria may occasionally include crustacean zooplankton such as copepods, crab
                zoals, barnacle nauplii, and other larval planktonic animals. Ctenophores, appendicularians, and other
                hydromedusae are among the gelatinous species eaten, as are sporadically other Aequorea victoria in the
                right circumstances. Long tentacles bearing nematocysts catch prey, and a highly contractile mouth that
                may extend to swallow creatures half the size of the medusae ingests it. Aequorea victoria density can
                be inversely associated to zooplankton density due to their voracious character, indicating a
                competitive presence in shared settings. Aequorea victoria are considered inefficient swimmers because
                their swimming speed does not rise as their body size does. So, in order to eat, they need to be in
                close proximity to their prey. This is accomplished successfully using energy propulsion, in which
                pressure enables them to passively move through their environment. Aequorea medusae are eaten by the
                voracious scyphozoa Cyanea capillata, commonly called the lion's mane jelly, as well as ctenophores,
                siphonophorae and other hydromedusae, including documented cases of cannibalism.[6] Many larger
                specimens are found with the parasitic hyperiid amphipod Hyperia medusarum attached to the either the
                subumbrella or exumbrella; these amphipods may burrow into the jelly, but such activities are not lethal
                to the jellyfish.
