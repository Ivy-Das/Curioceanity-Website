            <p>Phacellophora camtschatica, or fried egg jellyfish is a species that can be easily identified by the
                yellow colour in the body which looks like an egg yolk. These jellyfish are very large as the average
                size of the bell is 60 cm or 2 feet. This mostly found in the Mediterranean Sea in warm water. Since,
                the jellyfish does not possess any digestive, excretory or circulatory system they function through
                their large surface area of their body. This jellyfish has very limited movement and any movement done
                by this fish is caused mostly due to water current. They are found in cold water mostly in the Pacific
                Ocean.
            </p>
            <p>
                These organisms reproduce asexually and sexually. It feeds largely by snatching plankton and medusae
                with its tentacles and ingesting them in its mouth. Even when swimming, it can only move in a very
                limited manner and usually drifts with the stream. This species, as well as the majority of its
                relatives in the Cnidaria phylum, frequently use suspension feeding as their primary method of food
                acquisition. This jellyfish has no respiratory, circulatory, or excretory systems in its body. Instead,
                it achieves these goals by making advantage of its enormous surface. Additionally, this species uses
                mesolgea rather of a mesoderm, as do all others in the phylum Cnidaria. Due to the absence of three real
                tissue layers, this species (as well as all other cnidarians) are diploblastic rather than
                triploblastic. This jellyfish's reproductive and life cycle have both been extensively studied. It
                largely follows the same life cycle as other Scyphozoa of the same class. It alternates between the
                sexually reproducing medusa form and the asexual polyp form. These cool-water jellyfish can be found in
                most of the world's oceans, but the Northern Pacific is where they are most frequently found.

            <p>
                P. camtschatica is a sizable jellyfish with an opaque, white tissue enclosing a yellow center that
                resembles a cracked egg yolk. This jellyfish is a member of the Scyphozoa class and belongs to the
                Phacellophoridae family. It was formerly thought that this jellyfish belonged to the Ulmaridae family,
                but the juvenile traits did not match either family's characteristics (Ulmaridae or Cyaneidae). These
                discoveries led to the creation of the family Phacellophoridae, which stands between Cyaneidae and
                Ulmaridae and is specifically for this species. Broad curtain-like oral arms, a stomach cavity with
                radial canals joining a marginal ring canal, and subumbrellar tentacles in 16 linear clusters are key
                identifying characteristics. The only living member of the Phacellophoridae family is P. camtschatica.
                The most recent evolutionary studies, however, indicate that the genus Phacellophora belongs to the
                family Ulmaridae. Additionally, the genus Phacellophora exhibits cryptic diversity, with at least three
                or four different species.
            </p>
            <p>

                Phacellophora camtschatica typically eats tiny jellyfish and gelatinous zooplankton that get caught in
                the tentacles. Nematocysts found in the tentacles aid in the capturing of prey. Additionally, these
                buildings offer protection from predators. The tentacles wrap the food they have gathered in mucus,
                which is subsequently carried to the mouth by the oral lobes. After that, digestive enzymes in the
                gastrovascular cavity begin to break down the food. Food that has been broken down is subsequently
                dispersed throughout the jellyfish by cilia. Fish (including fish larvae) and other taxa, including
                other jellyfish like Aurelia spp., ctenophores, and Pelagia noctiluca, are among the many taxa that
                Phacellophora camtschatica feeds on. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It is known that the fried egg jellyfish harbor symbionts that move
                from the host to P. camtschatica when it is eaten. This is made possible by the jellyfish's weak sting,
                which enables a variety of symbionts and parasites, such as small crustaceans like larval crabs (Cancer
                gracilis) and some amphipoda (Hyperia medusarum), to frequently ride on its bell and even steal food
                from its oral arms and tentacles. Without gills, lungs, or a trachea, Phacellophora camtschatica cannot
                breathe. Instead, it breathes by diffusing water's oxygen through a thin membrane that covers its body.
                Low oxygenated water can be evacuated from the gastrovascular canal through the mouth, and high
                oxygenated water can be spread by the action of cilia, boosting the diffusion of oxygen into the cells.
                More oxygen and nutrients are diffused into the cells thanks to the increased surface area to volume
                ratio. Due of its large surface area to volume ratio, this animal also lacks specialized respiratory,
                excretory, and circulatory systems. 
            </p>
            <p>
                There are various components to the basic body layout. Food moves
                through the muscular manubrium while being spread out by the radial canals. The fried egg jelly and
                every other phylum member Cnidaria have two lobes. This is because the mesoderm, which in this phylum is
                replaced by mesoglea, does not exist. The gastrodervascular cavity with a gastrodermis, an epidermis,
                and a middle layer of mesoglea make up this species' tissue layers. In addition, a neural network that
                controls feeding reactions and muscular contractions in swimming is present. Cnidarians have two main
                body surfaces, the oral surface and the aboral surface, and exhibit radial symmetry, in which the
                tentacles are radially symmetric about the mouth. For better movement, the oral surface is directed
                downward during the medusa stage as opposed to upwards during the polyp stage.
            </p>
            <p>

                The Monterey Bay Aquarium maintains this jellyfish in captivity, so its life cycle is well known. Its
                sexual planktonic medusa stage, which reproduces in the water column, and its asexual benthic polyp
                stage, which is connected to rocks and piers, alternate during its life cycle. Both sexes are present in
                the planktonic form. The life cycle starts with the fertilization of eggs, which results in the
                development of ciliated planulae. Before settling, clinging to the bottom, and metamorphosing into the
                polyp (scyphistomae) stage, these planulae swim for around 3 to 5 days. Once in the polyp stage, the
                scyphistomae passes through a series of stages in the development of its tentacles, each of which
                signifies a change in the calyx's overall form and tentacle symmetry. 
            </p>
            <p>
                One bud per polyp and strobilating
                allow for asexual reproduction when the polyp is mature and has between 30 and 44 tentacles. The polyp
                lengthens and thins, the tentacles shorten and thicken, and mature ephraye are released during
                strobilation. A cruciform mouth with scattered nematocyst batteries appears when ephyrae are released.
                The tentacles of ephraye become longer and take on a filiform shape as they age. Medusae grow more
                tentacles, longer oral arms, and greater bell diameters. Centrifugal development occurs in the gastric
                system. Under laboratory circumstances, sexual maturity is attained in about 9 months and reproduction
                can be achieved within the water column. The cycle then repeats all over again.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite having a low relative abundance in open marine environments, this cool-water species is
                widespread throughout the world's oceans. But it can also be quite common, particularly close to the
                shore where it was discovered to predominate in the southern half of this region, in the Sea of Japan
                and the Sea of Okhotsk. But the majority of people are found alone. Both the western and eastern Bering
                Seas contained it. Additionally, it made up a sizable amount of the biomass of jellyfish in the northern
                California Current's waters. According to a study from 2011, the egg-yolk jelly prefers deep basins to
                shallow ones, with a considerable amount of this species only being found off West Kamchatka. This is in
                stark contrast to the other Ulmaridae family members that favor shallow water. This choice may be
                influenced by the person's bell size, which ranges from 5 to 59 cm. By enduring higher water currents
                and pressure, the jellyfish can probably swim in deeper seas thanks to its bell-shaped bell.
