        </div>

            <p>The blue ring octopus is a highly venomous cephalopod. They are found in coral or tide pods in the
                Pacific and Indian Oceans. They can be easily spotted due to their striking colour. They are yellow in
                colour and have blue rings on them which change colour to warn off other predators. Blue ringed octopi
                can be as small as 12 cm but still considered one of the world’s deadliest marine creatures. They
                contain a powerful neurotoxin known as tetrodotoxin. They can live up to 2 to 3 years. These octopi eat
                crabs, shrimps, and other smaller crustaceans. Using their dermal chromatophore cells, blue-ringed
                octopuses may effectively disguise themselves by spending the most of their time in fissures. Since they
                can readily change their shapes, octopuses in general are able to fit into spaces that are much smaller
                than they are. In order to protect the octopus from predators, it does this as well as stacking boulders
                outside the entrance to its burrow. As an aposematic warning display, they quickly change color when
                provoked, turning bright yellow and each of the 50 to 60 rings flashing bright iridescent blue within a
                third of a second. The larger blue-ringed octopus' rings are made up of iridophores, multi-layer light
                reflectors.

            <p>
                In order to reflect blue-green light in a broad viewing direction, these are positioned in
                that way. Dark pigmented chromatophores can be expanded in a matter of seconds beneath and around each
                ring to increase the contrast between them. This is rare for cephalopods because they generally utilize
                chromatophores to cover or spectrally change iridescence. There are also no chromatophores above the
                ring. Muscles under brain control are used to produce the rapid flashes of the blue rings. Regular
                muscular contractions above the iridophores cover each ring to conceal it. These loosen, exposing the
                iridescence, which then reveals the blue color, and the muscles outside the ring constrict. The octopus
                secretes venom that contains tetrodotoxin, dopamine, taurine, histamine, tryptamine, and octopamine. If
                the venom is not treated, symptoms like as nausea, respiratory arrest, heart failure, severe and
                occasionally total paralysis, blindness, and death within minutes may occur. Death frequently results
                from asphyxia brought on by the diaphragm's paralysis. The octopus's posterior salivary gland is where
                the venom is made. The salivary glands are found in the intestinal blood space and have a tubuloacinar
                exocrine structure.

                A substance formerly identified as maculotoxin, which is also present in pufferfish,
                rough-skinned newts, and some poison dart frogs, has been discovered to be the main neurotoxin in
                blue-ringed octopuses. Tetrodotoxin blocks sodium channels, causing motor paralysis and respiratory
                arrest within minutes of exposure. The octopus's own sodium channels are adapted to be resistant to
                tetrodotoxin. The tetrodotoxin is produced by bacteria in the salivary glands of the octopus. The
                octopus' first reaction when faced with danger is to run away. The octopus will assume a defensive
                stance and flash its blue rings if the threat continues. The octopus may bite its attacker if it is
                cornered and touched. There have been between seven and sixteen deaths attributed to blue-ringed
                octopuses, according to various estimates; most academics agree that there have been at least eleven.
                Nearly every gland and organ in its body has venom. Tetrodotoxin has been discovered to be present in
                even delicate parts like the Needham's sac, branchial heart, nephridia, and gills, and it has no impact
                on the octopus's regular operations.

                This might be made possible through a special blood transfer. The
                neurotoxic will be injected by the mother into the eggs before hatching. According to data from the
                International Union for Conservation of Nature, the blue-ringed octopus population is now categorized as
                being of Least Concern (IUCN). Threats to population numbers, however, may include species collections
                for the aquarium trade, habitat deterioration, overfishing, bioprospecting, habitat fragmentation, and
                human disturbance. It's conceivable that hapalochlaena contribute to a number of benefits for marine
                conservation. The stability of the habitat biodiversity and expansion of the marine food webs are both
                supported by this genus of octopus. Asian date mussel populations might be reduced by different species
                of blue-ringed octopus. The blue-ringed octopus produces tetrodotoxins, which could lead to new medical
                breakthroughs in the future.
