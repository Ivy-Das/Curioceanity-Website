            <p>Sei Whale</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Sei whales belong to the family Balaenoptera borealis and is a type of baleen whale. It found mostly in
                deep offshore waters. It is 68 feet long and weighs 28 tons. Sei whales mostly eat copepods and krill.
                This species of whale is also threatened due to increased poaching and hunting for commercial sale
                before 2008. Now, due to a declaration made by the UN it is illegal to hunt sei whales. Pollock, also
                known as coalfish and a close relative of codfish, is referred to as "sei" in Norwegian. Both the
                pollock and the sei whales first came off the Norwegian coast at the same period, traveling there to eat
                the plentiful plankton. The particular name is the northern-sounding Latin word borealis. The
                epithet "finner" was frequently used to describe rorquals. In the Pacific, the whale has been referred
                to as the Japan finner. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The whale's name in Japanese is iwashi kujira, or sardine whale; it was first
                used by early Japanese whalers to refer to Bryde's whales. Later, it was mistaken for the sei whale when
                modern whaling moved to Sanriku, where both species are found. After the blue whale (up to 180 tonnes,
                200 tons) and the fin whale (up to 70 tonnes, 77 tons), the sei whale is the third-largest
                balaenopterid, however it is relatively small compared to the humpback whale. Adult males and females in
                the North Pacific average 13.7 meters (45 feet) and 15 meters (49 feet), respectively, and weigh 15 and
                18.5 tonnes (16.5 and 20.5 tons), whereas those in the North Atlantic average 14 meters (46 feet) and
                14.5 meters (48 feet), respectively, and weigh 15.5 and 17 tonnes (17 and 18.5 tons). The body of the
                whale is usually dark steel grey with sporadic light grey to white patterns on the ventral surface or in
                the front of the lower body. Comparatively speaking to other species, the whale has a very brief set of
                32 to 60 pleats or grooves along its ventral surface that limit the enlargement of the buccal cavity
                while feeding.

                The pectoral fins are only 9% to 10% of body length, are relatively short, and are pointed at
                the tips. The rostrum is pointed. The rostrum tip to the pair of blowholes that are a defining feature
                of baleen whales are connected by a single ridge. This rorqual feeds by filtering through water with its
                baleen plates, opening its mouth to ingest or skim huge quantities of the water holding the food, then
                straining the water out through the baleen, trapping any food particles inside. Averaging roughly 900 kg
                of food each day, the sei whale feeds close to the ocean's surface by swimming through swarms of prey
                while lying on its side. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Generally speaking, given an animal of its size, its favored foods—such as
                zooplankton and small fish—lie abnormally comparatively low in the food chain. Long, low-frequency
                sounds are produced by sei whales. Although specific cries are not well understood, observers have heard
                sei whale calls as well as sounds that might be "growls" or "whooshes" off the coast of the Antarctic
                Peninsula. Numerous calls included numerous portions that were broadcast at various frequencies. This
                combination sets their calls distinct from those of other whales. Most calls lasted around half a second
                and took place in the audible range of 240 to 625 hertz. The vocal sequences have a maximum volume of
                156 dB. A vocalizing whale would sound like a jackhammer working two meters away to someone standing one
                meter away. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Scientists captured sei whale cries off the coast of Maui in November 2002. All of the calls
                were downswept tonal calls, with the exception of two that went from an average high frequency of 39.1
                Hz down to 21 Hz during a 1.3 second period. The two higher frequency downswept calls ranged from an
                average high frequency of 100.3 Hz to 44.6 Hz over a one second period. The sei whale typically makes an
                annual migration from cool, subpolar waters in the summer to temperate, subtropical areas in the winter
                when there is more food available. Sightings and catch records in the northwest Atlantic indicate that
                the whales migrate north along the shelf edge, arriving in the Georges Bank, Northeast Channel, and
                Browns Bank regions by mid- to late June. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In August and September, they can be found off the south coast
                of Newfoundland. From mid-September to mid-November, they migrate southbound along the Nova Scotian
                shelf. Later in the summer, whales in the Labrador Sea as early as the first week of June can migrate
                further north to waters southwest of Greenland. The development of explosive harpoons and steam-powered
                whaling ships in the late nineteenth century brought previously unobtainable large whales within reach
                of commercial whalers. Initially their speed and elusiveness, and later the comparatively small
                yield of oil and meat partially protected them. Once stocks of more profitable right whales, blue
                whales, fin whales, and humpback whales became depleted, sei whales were hunted in earnest, particularly
                from 1950 to 1980. Before 1970, when the International Whaling Commission first established capture
                quotas for the North Pacific for specific species, the sei whale lacked significant international
                protection. There were no legal restrictions before quotas. In the North Pacific, complete protection
                against commercial whaling began in 1976. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In the North Atlantic, quotas on sei whales were introduced in
                1977. Stocks in the Southern Hemisphere were safeguarded in 1979. The International Whaling Commission
                (IWC) banned commercial whaling entirely starting in 1986 in response to mounting evidence that several
                whale species were in danger of going extinct. Some "pirate" whaling occurred in the eastern North
                Atlantic in the late 1970s. Although there is no concrete proof of illegal whaling in the North Pacific,
                catch records are not totally credible due to the Soviet Union's acknowledged falsification of whaling
                data. Sei whale major extinctions have been documented for many years, and evidence implies that endemic
                poisoning (red tide) reasons may have contributed to mass extinctions in the distant past. The largest
                mass beaching ever recorded occurred in June 2015, when 337 dead sei whales were discovered by
                scientists flying over southern Chile. Although the exact origin is unknown, the Blob, an extraordinary
                warming event in the Pacific Ocean, may be to blame for harmful algal blooms.
