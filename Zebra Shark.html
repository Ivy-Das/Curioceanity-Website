            <p>Zebra Shark</p>

            <p>Zebra sharks are of the Stegostomatidae family and are found in the Indo-Pacific region among coral reefs
                which are around 62 meters deep. They can be easily identified by their ridges and spots on a lighter
                undertone on their back. They are nocturnal creatures and hunt for crustaceans and molluscs, sometimes
                they also like to hunt sea-snakes found in little crevices of rocks or caves. Zebra sharks are also
                considered endangered due to capturing and selling and inability to maintain the lifestyle of the shark.
                Because they are nocturnal, zebra sharks spend the most of the day dozing out on the ocean floor. They
                vigorously search the reef's cracks and holes at night for mollusks, crustaceans, tiny bony fish, and
                sometimes sea snakes. 
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>                Despite spending most of the year alone, they gather in big groups during certain
                seasons. The zebra shark is an oviparous species, meaning that the females produce a large number of egg
                capsules that are attached to submerged objects by sticky tendrils. They make ideal topics for
                ecotourism dives and public aquariums because they are harmless to humans and resilient in captivity.
                This species has been classified as Endangered by the World Conservation Union because commercial
                fishermen take the majority of its range for meat, fins, and liver oil. There is proof that they are
                getting fewer.

            <p>
                The cylindrical body of the zebra shark is topped with a big, somewhat flattened head and a short, blunt
                snout. The spiracles are situated behind the small, side-mounted eyes and are at least as large as those
                eyes. The fourth and fifth short gill slits are much closer together than the other two, and the last
                three of the five are located over the bases of the pectoral fins. A narrow barbel and a groove connect
                each nostril to the mouth. With three lobes on the lower lip and furrows at the corners, the mouth is
                nearly straight. The upper jaw has 28 to 33 tooth rows, while the lower jaw has 22 to 32. Each tooth has
                a big central cusp that is surrounded by two smaller ones. In adults, the body has five distinct ridges:
                two on the sides and one along the dorsal midline. The first dorsal fin, which is situated roughly
                midway along the body and is twice as large as the second dorsal fin, merges with the dorsal midline
                ridge. The pelvic and anal fins are somewhat smaller but larger than the second dorsal fin, and the
                pectoral fins are big and broad. With a weak ventral notch close to the tip of the upper lobe and a
                barely formed lower lobe, the caudal fin is almost as long as the remainder of the body. The zebra shark
                grows to a maximum length of 2.5 meters, with an unconfirmed record of 3.5 meters. There is no size
                difference between males and females. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Young sharks have a dark brown color pattern above and a light
                yellow color pattern below, along with vertical yellow stripes and dots. The black regions start to
                separate as the shark reaches a length of 50 to 90 cm, which transforms the basic pattern from
                light-on-dark stripes to dark-on-light dots. Adults have significant pattern variation that can be
                utilized to pinpoint specific individuals. A unusual variation known as the "sandy zebra shark" lacks
                the distinctive dark-spotted and banded pattern typical of the species and is generally sandy-brown in
                color with barely noticeable dark brown freckles on its upperside. It is unknown how juveniles of this
                morph look, however subadult sandy zebra sharks who are becoming adults exhibit a brown-netted pattern.
                Adult sandy zebra sharks often display faint traces of this pattern. Though apparently related
                individuals have been reported from Japan and northwest Australia, this morph, which is genetically
                indistinguishable from the typical morph, is only known from the area around Malindi in Kenya. From
                South Africa through the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, to India and Southeast Asia, north to Taiwan and
                Japan, east to New Caledonia and Tonga, and south to northern Australia, the zebra shark can be found in
                the tropical waters of the Indo-Pacific region.

                The zebra shark is a bottom-dwelling species that
                inhabits the continental and insular shelves from the intertidal zone to a depth of 62 meters. Coral
                reefs, debris, and sandy places are frequented by adults and large juveniles. Unfounded claims claim
                that this species has been found in freshwater in the Philippines. Zebra sharks occasionally travel
                across oceans to reach remote seamounts. Individual sharks have been observed traveling as far as 140
                kilometers. However, despite the fact that zebra shark populations' ranges are contiguous, genetic
                research suggests that there is limited interpopulation migration. From South Africa through the Red Sea
                and the Persian Gulf, to India and Southeast Asia, north to Taiwan and Japan, east to New Caledonia and
                Tonga, and south to northern Australia, the zebra shark can be found in the tropical waters of the
                Indo-Pacific region. The zebra shark is a bottom-dwelling species that inhabits the continental and

                The zebra shark preys mostly on
                mollusks with shells, but it also consumes crustaceans, tiny bony fish, and perhaps sea snakes. This
                shark's small mouth and heavily muscled buccal cavity enable it to remove prey with a strong suction
                force. Its slim, flexible body also enables it to squeeze into tight spaces and cracks in quest of food.
                Larger fish, particularly other larger sharks, and marine animals may prey on this species. Four kinds
                of tapeworms from the genus Pedibothrium are recognized as parasites of the zebra shark. Zebra sharks
                are mostly solitary, however groups of 20 to 50 have been observed. Every summer, groups of several
                hundred zebra sharks gather in shallow water off southeast Queensland. These groups are all made up of
                huge adults, with nearly three to one more females than males. Since no distinct shark mating behavior
                has been noticed, it is still unclear what the aim of these gatherings is. 
            </p>
            <p>
                A zebra shark adult male was
                seen biting another adult male's pectoral fin and forcing him against the bottom of the ocean; the
                second male was flipped on his back and was immobile for a number of minutes. This behavior resembles
                pre-copulatory behaviors between male and female sharks, and in both cases the biting and holding of the
                pectoral fin has been speculated to relate to one shark asserting dominance over the other. Zebra sharks
                can be easily approached underwater and pose little threat to humans. They have, however, bit divers who
                tug on their tails. The International Shark Assault File only contains one instance of an unprovoked
                attack as of 2008; nonetheless, no one was hurt. In the Red Sea, in the Maldives, off Thailand's Phuket
                and Phi Phi islands, on the Great Barrier Reef, and elsewhere, they are well-liked tourism attractions
                for ecotourist divers. At diving locations, many zebra sharks are acclimated to people's presence and
                will take food from divers' hands and allow themselves to be petted. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Zebra sharks are kept in captivity
                and are frequently seen in public aquariums across the world. The small, attractively colored young also
                find their way into the hands of private hobbyists, though this species grows far too large for the home
                aquarium. In the majority of its range, the zebra shark is caught commercially using bottom trawls,
                gillnets, and longlines. For human consumption, the flesh is offered fresh or dried and salted.
                Additionally, the offal is utilized to make fishmeal and the fins and liver oil are used to make shark
                fin soup. Due to their shallow habitat and poor levels of population dispersal, zebra sharks are
                particularly vulnerable to localized depletion, and market surveys indicate that they are substantially
                less abundant than they formerly were. They are also endangered by harmful fishing methods like
                dynamiting and poisoning, as well as by human development that destroys the coral reef ecosystem. The
                World Conservation Union has classified this species as Endangered as a result. Off Australia, the only
                threat to this species is a very low level of bycatch in prawn trawls, and there it has been assessed as
                of Least Concern.
