            <p>Great white sharks or white sharks are a part of the family Carcharodon carcharias. They are called
                “great white” because of their size and their white underside. The females can grow up to 20 feet but
                the males can grow up to 11 to 14 feet. These sharks have no predators besides the orca. These are a
                type of sharks which are considered vulnerable by the UN as they have to travel long distances for
                seasonal migration and they also have a very demanding diet. The Australian government also works
                towards protecting the sharks. Due to their size and demanding diet they are not kept in captive and no
                aquarium has ever had a live specimen of the white shark. Interestingly, even though their diets are of
                enormous proportions they rarely attack humans and prefer to eat other sharks, seals or sea lions. They
                are found mostly near off-shore coasts where the temperature is between 12℃ to 24℃. These sharks are
                also considered slightly endangered by the UN. 
            </p>
                <p>
                Aside from the orca on extremely rare instances, the great white shark has no other known natural predators, making it an apex predator. It is one of the
                main predators of marine mammals up to the size of huge baleen whales and is possibly the largest known
                living macropredator fish. In addition to fish and seabirds, this shark is known to feed on a range of
                other marine creatures. It is the only species of its genus, Carcharodon, that is still alive and has
                been implicated in more documented cases of human bites than any other shark. The great white is one of
                five identified extant species in the family Lamnidae and the only recognized extant species in the
                genus Carcharodon. The salmon shark, porbeagle, and mako sharks are further members of this family. The
                family is a member of the mackerel shark order, Lamniformes. The striking white underbelly of the
                shark—a distinguishing characteristic particularly visible in beached sharks resting upside down with
                their stomachs exposed—is supposed to have given rise to the English name "white shark" and its
                Australian counterpart, "white pointer." 
                </p>
                <p>
                The term "great white shark" is more frequently used in casual
                contexts, probably because the prefix "great" emphasizes the species' size and power. Another reason
                could be that the term "white shark" was historically used to refer to the oceanic white-tipped shark.
                Because the former shark was much smaller than the former, it was given the name "Great" because the
                term "white" had already been used to refer to another shark, which was later called the "lesser white
                shark." Since the term "lesser white shark" is no longer used, the majority of scientists prefer "white
                shark." Some people refer to all Lamnidae members collectively as "white sharks."

            <p>
                The mako sharks of the genus Isurus, which split sometime between 60 and 43 million years ago, were
                found to be the closest extant relatives of the great white, according to molecular clock studies
                published between 1988 and 2002. Yet more paleontological research needs to be done in order to
                determine how this evolutionary relationship might be traced through fossil data. The initial theory on
                the ancestry of the great white shark was that it descended from a lineage of mega-toothed sharks and
                was closely related to the extinct megalodon. These sharks were much bigger, with the megalodon reaching
                estimated lengths of up to 14.2 to 16 meters. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The primary evidence for a close evolutionary link between
                great white and mega-toothed sharks came from similarities between their teeth, including their massive
                triangular forms, serrated blades, and the existence of dental bands. As a result, researchers put the
                prehistoric forms in the genus Carcharodon. Paleontologists were able to trace the hypothetical lineage
                back to a 60-million-year-old shark known as Cretalamna as the common ancestor of all sharks within the
                Lamnidae, despite weaknesses in the hypothesis, such as uncertainty over precisely which species evolved
                into the modern great white and numerous gaps in the fossil record. However, it is now understood that
                the great white shark holds closer ties to the mako sharks and is descended from a separate lineage as a
                chronospecies unrelated to the mega-toothed sharks.
            </p>
            <p>
                The social organization and behavior of this shark are intricate. White sharks have a dominance
                hierarchy in South Africa based on size, sex, and squatter's rights: Males are outnumbered by females,
                bigger sharks outnumber smaller sharks, and locals outnumber visitors. Great whites often separate and
                settle disputes through rituals and displays while they are hunting. Although some individuals have been
                discovered with bite scars that resemble those of other white sharks, white sharks rarely engage in
                fight. This shows that great whites may bite to warn other great whites away from getting too close.
                White sharks may also bite to assert their authority, which is another explanation. Individual great
                whites may join in order to accidentally communicate knowledge about the presence of prey or the
                location of animal remains that can be scavenged, according to data collected from animal-borne
                telemetry transmitters and published in 2022 by the journal Royal Society Publishing. Future research
                can better comprehend the whole range of social interactions among huge marine creatures, such as the
                great white shark, as a result of biologging's ability to disclose social patterns. One of the only
                sharks known to consistently lift its head above the water's surface to look at other things, including
                prey, is the great white shark. Spies call this spy-hopping. 
            </p>
                <p>
                Blacktip reef sharks have also demonstrated
                this behavior in at least one group, but it's possible that they picked it up from interacting with
                people (it is theorized that the shark may also be able to smell better this way because smell travels
                through air faster than through water). White sharks are typically quite intelligent, curious, and may
                even engage in social behavior when the situation calls for it. White sharks have been seen coming and
                going from Seal Island in dependable "clans" of two to six people every year. It is uncertain if the
                clan members are connected, yet they coexist peacefully enough. In reality, it is probably most accurate
                to compare the social structure of a clan to that of a wolf pack because each member has a set rank and
                every clan has an alpha leader. When members of several clans come together, they create social rank
                through a variety of non-violent exchanges. The carnivorous great white shark feeds on fish (such as
                tuna, rays, and other sharks), cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises), pinnipeds (seals, fur seals,
                and sea lions), sea turtles, sea otters (Enhydra lutris), seabirds, and sea turtle eggs. Additionally,
                great white sharks have been observed consuming indigestible materials.

                <p>
                Till they reach a length of 3 meters or more, when their jaw cartilage mineralizes enough to withstand the impact of biting into
                larger prey species, juvenile white sharks primarily feed on fish, including other elasmobranchs. This
                is because their jaws are not strong enough to withstand the forces required to attack larger prey
                species, such as pinnipeds and cetaceans. Even though individual sharks appear to specialize in
                different types of prey depending on their preferences, great white sharks start to primarily hunt
                marine mammals once they reach a length of nearly 4 m. In areas where both species' feeding habits may
                overlap, there is a chance that the great white shark and the orca will compete with one another. On
                October 4, 1997, a situation was recorded at the Farallon Islands, off the coast of California. An
                estimated 3 to 4 m great white shark was paralyzed by an estimated 4.7 to 5.3 m female orca. The shark
                suffocated after being held upside down by the orca for fifteen minutes while inducing tonic immobility.
                The dead shark's liver was subsequently devoured by the orca. All of the great white sharks in the area
                are thought to have fled due to the aroma of the killed shark's carcass, missing out on a fantastic
                opportunity for a great seasonal feed. Another similar attack apparently occurred there in 2000, but its
                outcome is not clear.
